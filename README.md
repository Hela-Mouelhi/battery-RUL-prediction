# battery-RUL-prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on battery lifetime prediction and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation using data-driven machine learning models combined with reliability analysis (Weibull distribution).
The final solution is deployed as an interactive Flask web application allowing users to estimate:

🔮 Predicted battery lifetime (in cycles)

⏳ Remaining Useful Life (RUL)

⚠️ Failure probability using Weibull reliability modeling

🎯 Objectives

Predict the total cycle life of a battery using degradation features

Estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) at a given cycle

Compute failure probability using Weibull distribution

Provide an intuitive web interface for non-technical users
